Hospital Data Analysis Project (Excel)
Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of hospital data using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal was to process raw healthcare data to uncover insights regarding patient demographics, admission trends, and operational efficiency. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, this project demonstrates how data-driven decisions can improve hospital management.

Key Features & Tasks
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats (dates, categories, and patient IDs).

Descriptive Analysis: Calculated key metrics such as Average Length of Stay (ALOS), total admissions, and patient age distribution.

Data Transformation: Used advanced Excel formulas (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, IF statements) to categorize data.

Pivot Tables: Created dynamic summaries to analyze department-wise performance and peak admission times.

Data Visualization: Designed an interactive dashboard featuring:

Trend lines for patient inflow.

Bar charts for department-wise patient volume.

Pie charts for gender and age-group distribution.

Technologies Used
Tool: Microsoft Excel

Functions: Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting, Data Validation.

Domain: Healthcare Data Analytics.

Insights Derived
Department Performance: Identified which departments (e.g., ICU, General Ward, OPD) had the highest occupancy rates.

Patient Demographics: Analyzed which age groups or regions contribute most to hospital visits.

Efficiency: Tracked the time between admission and discharge to identify bottlenecks in patient turnover.

How to Use
Clone the repository:

Command for the terminal
git clone https://github.com/kamalyadav1/DATAANALYSIS_WITH_EXCELL.git
Navigate to the Data_Analysis_of_Hospital folder.

Open the .xlsx file in Microsoft Excel (preferably 2016 or later) to view the formulas and interactive dashboard.

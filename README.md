Hospital Data Analysis Project (Excel)
Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of hospital data using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal was to process raw healthcare data to uncover insights regarding patient demographics, admission trends, and operational efficiency. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, this project demonstrates how data-driven decisions can improve hospital management.

Key Features & Tasks
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats (dates, categories, and patient IDs).

Descriptive Analysis: Calculated key metrics such as Average Length of Stay (ALOS), total admissions, and patient age distribution.

Data Transformation: Used advanced Excel formulas (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, IF statements) to categorize data.

Pivot Tables: Created dynamic summaries to analyze department-wise performance and peak admission times.

Data Visualization: Designed an interactive dashboard featuring:

Trend lines for patient inflow.

Bar charts for department-wise patient volume.

Pie charts for gender and age-group distribution.

Technologies Used
Tool: Microsoft Excel

Functions: Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting, Data Validation.

Domain: Healthcare Data Analytics.

Insights Derived
Department Performance: Identified which departments (e.g., ICU, General Ward, OPD) had the highest occupancy rates.

Patient Demographics: Analyzed which age groups or regions contribute most to hospital visits.

Efficiency: Tracked the time between admission and discharge to identify bottlenecks in patient turnover.

How to Use
Clone the repository:

Command for the terminal
git clone https://github.com/kamalyadav1/DATAANALYSIS_WITH_EXCELL.git

Student Data Analysis Project (Excel)
Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of educational data from UK universities using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal was to process student performance data to uncover insights regarding gender distribution, preparation habits, and academic outcomes across core subjects. By transforming raw student data into actionable insights, this project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to evaluate educational effectiveness and student demographics.

Key Features & Tasks
Data Cleaning: Handled the standardization of student data formats and ensured consistency across subject scores and preparation categories.

Descriptive Analysis: Calculated key performance indicators, including the sum of scores for writing, reading, and math across different student segments.

Data Transformation: Used Excel functions to categorize students based on their completion of preparation courses and gender.

Pivot Tables: Created dynamic summaries to compare performance metrics between students who completed preparation and those who did not.

Data Visualization: Designed a visual dashboard featuring:

Pie charts for gender distribution (Male vs. Female) in universities.

Bar charts comparing subject-wise performance (Math, Reading, Writing) based on preparation status.

Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: For data processing, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.

Git & GitHub: For version control and hosting the project repository on macOS.

macOS Terminal: For managing the project environment and resolving repository structural issues.

Based on the images you uploaded, here are professional README.md descriptions for your Online Shipment and Student Performance projects.

1. Online Shipment Data Analysis (Excel)
Project Overview
This project involves a multi-dimensional analysis of global shipment and sales data to evaluate business profitability and operational trends. The goal was to identify which shipping modes and product categories drive the highest margins and how profitability has scaled over a four-year period.

Key Features & Tasks
Time-Series Analysis: Tracked annual profit growth from 2014 to 2017, identifying a consistent upward trend in revenue.

Operational Efficiency: Analyzed "Ship Mode" performance to determine the impact of delivery speed on total profit.

Categorical Profitability: Compared profit margins across Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology sectors.

Data Visualization: Designed a comprehensive dashboard including:

Horizontal Bar Charts: Showing annual profit growth (reaching over 90,000 in 2017).

Vertical Column Charts: Identifying "Standard Class" as the most profitable shipping mode.

Line & Area Graphs: Visualizing the massive lead of "Technology" in total profit compared to other categories.

3D Bar Charts: Tracking discount trends over time to ensure pricing strategies remained sustainable.

Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: Advanced Pivot Tables, Calculated Fields, and Interactive Charts.

Git/GitHub: For version control of analysis files.

2. Student Performance & Demographics Analysis
Project Overview
This project examines the factors influencing academic success in university settings. By analyzing a dataset of student scores in core competencies (Writing, Reading, and Math), the study explores the correlation between gender representation and the completion of test preparation courses.

Key Features & Tasks
Demographic Profiling: Quantified gender distribution in higher education, highlighting a dominant female student population.

Impact Assessment: Segregated performance data into "Completed" vs. "None" categories for preparation courses to measure academic lift.

Cross-Subject Benchmarking: Analyzed the relationship between different subject scores, noting that reading and writing scores often correlate closely.

Data Visualization:

Pie Charts: Highlighting that female students make up more than two-thirds of the university population in this dataset.

Grouped Bar Charts: Visualizing total scores across Math, Reading, and Writing, providing a clear comparison of aggregate performance between student groups.

Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and visualization.

GitHub: Documentation and project hosting.
